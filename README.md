# Basemap Tile Downloader for QGIS

[![CI](https://github.com/cvonk/AOI-Downloader-for-QGIS/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cvonk/AOI-Downloader-for-QGIS/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A QGIS plugin that exports a high-resolution GeoTIFF from a **WMS**, **WMTS**, or
**XYZ** basemap over a chosen rectangular extent.

It:
- Auto-detects whether the chosen layer is a WMS, WMTS, or XYZ tile source.
- Tiles the request over the extent — WMS `GetMap` at a chosen resolution/CRS,
  or WMTS / Web-Mercator `{z}/{x}/{y}` tiles at a chosen zoom level.
- Throttles requests adaptively (tuned per source type) and fetches tiles in
  parallel, with a configurable number of parallel downloads.
- Tracks progress in a resumable SQLite queue, so an interrupted run continues
  where it left off, and a re-run retries any tiles that failed previously.
- Georeferences each tile and mosaics them into a compressed, tiled GeoTIFF
  (with overviews), optionally reprojected to a chosen output CRS (selectable
  resampling) and cropped to the exact extent, then loads it into the project.

Requires the GDAL Python bindings (bundled with QGIS). Written for QGIS 3.40.8.

## Installation

The installable plugin lives in the **`aoi_downloader/`** sub-folder of this
repository (the repo root holds the README, licence and screenshots).

1. Copy the `aoi_downloader` folder into your QGIS plugins folder:
   `$env:APPDATA\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\`
2. In QGIS, open **Plugins ▸ Manage and Install Plugins ▸ Installed**.
3. Check the box next to **Basemap Tile Downloader** to activate it.

The tool then appears under **Web ▸ Basemap Tile Downloader…** and on the toolbar.

> If you are developing, `sync.ps1` in the parent folder mirrors every plugin
> package here into the QGIS plugins folder; pair it with the *Plugin Reloader*
> plugin.

## Usage

### 1. Match the coordinate reference system

Set the project CRS to suit your source by clicking the EPSG code in the
bottom-right of the window. WMS is requested in that CRS; XYZ/WMTS tiles are
fetched in their native CRS (EPSG:3857 for XYZ) and reprojected to the output
CRS you pick in the dialog — or left in the native CRS if you choose **None**
for the resampling. (For example, **EPSG:32632** for an Italian UTM-32 source.)

### 2. Add the basemap

**WMS** — get the WMS URL from your provider, then
**Layer ▸ Data Source Manager ▸ WMS/WMTS ▸ New**:
  - **Name** – e.g. `Copertura regioni WMS`
  - **URL** – e.g. `http://wms.pcn.minambiente.it/ogc?map=/ms_ogc/WMS_v1.3/raster/ortofoto_colore_12.map`

  Connect and add the layer (e.g. *Ortofoto a colori anno 2012 ▸ Copertura …
  WGS84 - UTM32*).

**WMTS** — **Layer ▸ Data Source Manager ▸ WMS/WMTS ▸ New**, connect to the
service's `GetCapabilities` URL and add a WMTS layer / tile matrix set.

**XYZ** — **Layer ▸ Data Source Manager ▸ XYZ ▸ New**, give it a name and a
`{z}/{x}/{y}` URL template.

### 3. Export to GeoTIFF

Open **Web ▸ Basemap Tile Downloader…**. Pick the source layer (the dialog shows
the fields for its type), choose the **extent to render**, then set the output.

![Basemap Tile Downloader dialog](media/dialog.png)

The **Extent to render** selector works like QGIS's *Convert Map to Raster*
dialog — set it from the dropdown:
- **Calculate from Layer** – the bounding box of a layer,
- **Use Current Map Canvas Extent** – the current view,
- or type the min/max coordinates directly.

**WMS example**

| Setting | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Source layer | `Copertura regioni WMS` |
| Extent to render | Current map canvas extent |
| Tile size | `1024` |
| Resolution | `0.5` |
| Output CRS | `EPSG:32632` |
| Reproject sampling | `Bilinear` (or Nearest / Cubic / None) |
| Crop output to the exact extent | ☐ |
| Parallel downloads (Advanced) | `2` (lower for strict servers) |
| Output | `C:\Users\you\output.tif` (or a temporary file) |

**XYZ example**

| Setting | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Source layer | `OpenStreetMap` |
| Extent to render | Current map canvas extent |
| Zoom level | `18` (≈ 0.6 m/px) |
| Output CRS | `EPSG:32632` |
| Reproject sampling | `Bilinear` (or Nearest / Cubic / None) |
| Crop output to the exact extent | ☐ |
| Parallel downloads (Advanced) | `4` |
| Output | `C:\Users\you\output.tif` (or a temporary file) |

(A **WMTS** layer uses the same fields as XYZ — pick a **zoom level**.)

Notes:
- The dialog shows a live tile-count estimate as you adjust the settings; above
  about 5,000 tiles it asks for confirmation (and a Terms-of-Service reminder)
  before starting, to avoid an accidental huge download.
- **Reproject sampling: None** keeps the mosaic in its native CRS (no
  reprojection, no resampling).
- **Crop output to the exact extent** trims the tile-aligned mosaic to the
  precise extent rectangle.
- **Parallel downloads** and **Maximum attempts per tile** are in the collapsible
  **Advanced** section. Lower the parallel downloads (1–2) for strict servers
  that reject many simultaneous connections; WMS defaults to 2, XYZ/WMTS to 4.

Click **OK** to start. Progress is shown in the Task Manager, and the finished
mosaic is added to the project automatically.

## Q & A

**Why is my map blurry?**
Check that the resolution / zoom and the coordinate reference systems suit your
source. For XYZ, requesting a zoom finer than the provider serves only
interpolates — it adds no real detail.

**Why are some tiles missing?**
Tiles can fail from server-side rate-limiting/throttling or a transient server
error (the completion message and `download.log` report how many failed).
**Just run the export again with the same settings** — it keeps the tiles
already downloaded and retries the failed ones, so the gaps fill in once the
server cooperates. If a specific server keeps failing many parallel requests,
lower **Parallel downloads** (to 1–2). For XYZ, `404`/`204` tiles are treated as
legitimate gaps (no data at that tile).

**A run failed with a WMS `ServiceException` about a file it can't open.**
That's the *provider's* server failing to read its own data (often intermittent)
— not a plugin or network problem on your side. Wait and re-run; the failed
tiles will be retried.

**Which version of QGIS is this for?**
It was written for QGIS 3.40.8.

**Can I run it from the QGIS Python Console?**
Yes — the source backend is auto-detected from the layer you pass:

```python
from aoi_downloader import engine
from qgis.core import QgsProject
from qgis.utils import iface

wms = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName("Copertura regioni WMS")[0]

extent = iface.mapCanvas().extent()               # any QgsRectangle
extent_crs = QgsProject.instance().crs().authid()

# WMS: opts = {tile_pixels, resolution};  XYZ/WMTS: opts = {zoom}
engine.run(layer=wms, extent=extent, extent_crs=extent_crs,
           opts={"tile_pixels": 1024, "resolution": 0.5},
           out_crs="EPSG:32632",
           resample="bilinear",            # near | bilinear | cubic | none
           clip=True,                      # crop to the exact extent
           concurrency=2,                  # parallel tile fetches
           output_path=r"C:\Users\you\output.tif")  # or temporary=True for a temp file
```
